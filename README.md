# Vector Meson production

Code used for calculation of vector meson production in UPC collisions.

Before compiling, check you have installed all the dependencies: GSL, Cuba, and ROOT for plotting.

To compile, use the commands below:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ../
make
```

which will create a *build/* directory and compile it there. The compiled program will then be *build/VMProduction*.
