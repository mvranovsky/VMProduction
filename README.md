# Vector Meson production

Code used for calculation of vector meson production in UPC collisions.

To compile, use the commands below:

<pre>
'''bash
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ../
make
'''
</pre>

which will create a *build/* directory and compile it there. The compiled program will then be *build/VMProduction*.
